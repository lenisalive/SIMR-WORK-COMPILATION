Above is the drive that contains all my models and data cleansing for my car crashes project.
The extra repeat CSVs are from data cleaning and dummy variable creation.
The 2 IPYNB files have a majority of the data sorting and cleansing code as well as some analysis.
There are various PKL files that contain the different models I applied.
